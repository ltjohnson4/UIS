UIS Drug Treatment Study

The [UIS Drug Treatment Study](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/quantreg/uis.html) randomly assigned 628 persons addicted to drugs to shorter (control) or longer (intervention) treatment programs. Complete data are available for 575 observations. I want to know if the time to relapse is significantly different for those two groups.

R packages used:
- ggplot
- tidyverse
